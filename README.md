# CLAI

*Catchy AI-generated intro*:

CLAI is a CLI AI that brings the power of artificial intelligence right to your terminal. Imagine having an intelligent assistant that can chat, suggest commands, and explain complex CLI instructions without ever having to leave your terminal. Boost your productivity and streamline your workflow with CLAI!

### Before getting started

Currently, the software can only be built from source using Rust. Pre-built binaries are not available at this time (sorry, no `.exe` file).

The software has only been tested on Linux (specifically Ubuntu 22.04 and later) and will most likely not work on other platforms. There are currently no plans to support other platforms in the future.

### Supported Providers

More providers may be added in the future

âœ… **OpenAI**

#### Obtaining API Keys

You will need to obtain API keys from LLM providers. Follow the provider's instructions to generate and retrieve your API key.

# Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below.

### Requirements

- git
- rust

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JazzyMcJazz/clai.git
```

### Run the Installation Script (Linux only)

Navigate to the project directory and run the installation script:

```sh
cd clai
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This will prompt you to build or skip building the project. It must be built the first time and whenever updates have been fetched. After the installation, the script will prompt you to create aliases. If you accept, it will add the aliases `chat`, `suggest`, and `explain` to your `.bash_aliases`.

The installation script builds the binary and copies it to `/usr/local/bin`.

### You're all set!

You can now start using the project. For further instructions, refer to the documentation below.

# Usage 

Run `clai` to start the program. Initially you will have to setup a provider with an API key. API keys are encrypted and stored securely and never leave your machine, except when used to authenticate with LLM providers.

You can setup a provider by running `clai` and selecting `Options`. After setting up a provider you can change the model by going back into the Options menu.
