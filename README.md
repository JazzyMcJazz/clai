### Before getting started

Currently, the software can only be built from source using Rust. Pre-built binaries are not available at this time (sorry, no `.exe` file).

The software has only been tested on **Linux** (specifically Ubuntu 22.04 and later) and will most likely not work on other platforms. There are currently no plans to support other platforms in the future.

### Supported Providers

More providers may be added in the future

âœ… **OpenAI**

#### Obtaining API Keys

You will need to obtain API keys from LLM providers. Follow the provider's instructions to generate and retrieve your API key.

# Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below.

### Requirements

- git
- rust

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JazzyMcJazz/clai.git
```

### Install the application

Navigate to the project directory and run the installation command:

```sh
cd clai
cargo install --path .
```

### You're all set!

You can now start using the project. For further instructions, refer to the [usage section](#usage).

### Getting updates

To keep your installation up to date, navigate to the project directory and pull the latest commits from the repository:

```sh
cd clai
git pull origin main
```

After pulling the latest changes, reinstall the application:

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

This will ensure you have the latest features and bug fixes.

# Usage 

Run `clai` to start the program. Initially you will have to setup a provider with an API key. API keys are encrypted and stored securely and never leave your machine, except when used to authenticate with LLM providers.

You can setup a provider by running `clai` and selecting `Options`. After setting up a provider you can change the model by going back into the Options menu.
